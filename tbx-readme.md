# README

This document was set up using a Tinderbox installer — a one-line action code that fetches components from GitHub and installs them into your document.

## What Was Installed

- **README** — This note, providing basic documentation.

## About This Installer

This installer was built from the [tbx-installer](https://github.com/jacobio/tbx-installer) template — a forkable project for creating GitHub-backed Tinderbox installers.

## Customizing

To add your own components, edit `install.tbxc` in the GitHub repo. You can create prototypes, templates, stamps, syntax highlighters, and more — all fetched from GitHub at install time.

## Re-running

This installer is safe to re-run. It uses `create()`, which updates existing notes rather than duplicating them.
